# Assignment 1: A* Search - Optimality and Heuristics

This project explores the A* search algorithm, with a specific focus on the heuristic properties of **admissibility** and **consistency**.

The repository contains both the theoretical analysis and a practical programming implementation of the concepts. It covers the definitions of these key heuristic properties, works through examples to show their effects, and uses a Python implementation to solve a maze problem.

### Project Files

* **`Assignment 01.pdf`**: This document contains the detailed written answers for the conceptual, worked-example, and critical-thinking sections [Part A, B & D].

* **`Assignment 01.ipynb`**: This is a Jupyter Notebook that contains the Python implementation of the A* algorithm designed to solve a maze problem [Part C].
